	<h2 align="center"> Medium Blogs API </h2>
	<h4 align="center"> Medium is a blog posting service that is used by many organizations across the world to post tutorials, many DIY guides, create awareness about their product, etc. Medium on its own doesnâ€™t provide any API for the users to showcase their work on their websites or on other platforms.
Hence, the project's aim was to create an easy to use API, that could be used to fetch and integrate Medium Posts of a user or an organization to a website or other Application platforms.
